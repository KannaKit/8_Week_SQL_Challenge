# ðŸ¥‘ Case Study #3 - Foodie-Fi
## ðŸ’³ C. Challenge Payment Question

The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new `payments` table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the `subscriptions` table with the following requirements:

* monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original `start_date` of any monthly paid plan
* upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
* upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
* once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

Example outputs for this table might look like the following (first 8 rows):

| customer_id | plan_id | plan_name     | payment_date | amount | payment_order |
|-------------|---------|---------------|--------------|--------|---------------|
| 1           | 1       | basic monthly | 2020-08-08   | 9.90   | 1             |
| 1           | 1       | basic monthly | 2020-09-08   | 9.90   | 2             |
| 1           | 1       | basic monthly | 2020-10-08   | 9.90   | 3             |
| 1           | 1       | basic monthly | 2020-11-08   | 9.90   | 4             |
| 1           | 1       | basic monthly | 2020-12-08   | 9.90   | 5             |
| 2           | 3       | pro annual    | 2020-09-27   | 199.00 | 1             |
| 13          | 1       | basic monthly | 2020-12-22   | 9.90   | 1             |
| 15          | 2       | pro monthly   | 2020-03-24   | 19.90  | 1             |
