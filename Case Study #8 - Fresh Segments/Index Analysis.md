# üçä Case Study #8 - Fresh Segments
## üìí Index Analysis

The `index_value` is a measure which can be used to reverse calculate the average `composition` for Fresh Segments‚Äô clients.

Average composition can be calculated by dividing the composition column by the `index_value` column rounded to 2 decimal places.

### 1. What is the top 10 interests by the average composition for each month?

```TSQL
WITH cte AS (
SELECT 
  month_year,
  interest_id,
  ROUND(CAST(composition/index_value AS NUMERIC),2) avg_composition,
  RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY month_year ORDER BY ROUND(CAST(composition/index_value AS NUMERIC),2) DESC) rank_n
FROM interest_metrics
WHERE month_year IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY month_year, avg_composition DESC
)

SELECT
  month_year,
  interest_id,
  interest_name,
  interest_summary,
  avg_composition
FROM cte
LEFT JOIN interest_map map ON cte.interest_id=map.id
WHERE rank_n <= 10
ORDER BY month_year, rank_n;
```

First 5 rows.

| month_year | interest_id | interest_name                 | interest_summary                                                                                                                                          | avg_composition |

### 2. For all of these top 10 interests - which interest appears the most often?

```TSQL
WITH cte AS (
SELECT 
  month_year,
  interest_id,
  ROUND(CAST(composition/index_value AS NUMERIC),2) avg_composition,
  RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY month_year ORDER BY ROUND(CAST(composition/index_value AS NUMERIC),2) DESC) rank_n
FROM interest_metrics
WHERE month_year IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY month_year, avg_composition DESC),

cte2 AS (
SELECT
  month_year,
  interest_id,
  interest_name,
  interest_summary,
  avg_composition
FROM cte
LEFT JOIN interest_map map ON cte.interest_id=map.id
WHERE rank_n <= 10
ORDER BY month_year, rank_n),

cte3 AS (
SELECT 
  COUNT(interest_id) interest_id_count,
  interest_name, 
  interest_summary
FROM cte2
GROUP BY interest_id, interest_name, interest_summary
ORDER BY interest_id_count DESC)

SELECT
  interest_id_count,
  interest_name,
  interest_summary
FROM cte3
WHERE interest_id_count=10
GROUP BY interest_id_count, interest_name, interest_summary;
```

### 3. What is the average of the average composition for the top 10 interests for each month?

```TSQL
WITH cte AS (
SELECT 
  month_year,
  interest_id,
  ROUND(CAST(composition/index_value AS NUMERIC),2) avg_composition,
  RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY month_year ORDER BY ROUND(CAST(composition/index_value AS NUMERIC),2) DESC) rank_n
FROM interest_metrics
WHERE month_year IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY month_year, avg_composition DESC),

cte2 AS (
SELECT
  month_year,

  interest_name,
  interest_summary,
  avg_composition
FROM cte
LEFT JOIN interest_map map ON cte.interest_id=map.id
WHERE rank_n <= 10
ORDER BY month_year, rank_n)

SELECT 
  month_year,
  ROUND(AVG(avg_composition),2) avg_avg_composition
FROM cte2
GROUP BY month_year
ORDER BY 1;
```

| month_year | avg_avg_composition |
|------------|---------------------|
