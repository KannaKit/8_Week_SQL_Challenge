## ðŸ§¹ 1. Data Cleaning Steps

In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named `clean_weekly_sales`:

* Convert the `week_date` to a `DATE` format
* Add a `week_number` as the second column for each `week_date` value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
* Add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each `week_date` value as the 3rd column
* Add a `calendar_year` column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
* Add a new column called `age_band` after the original `segment` column using the following mapping on the number inside the `segment` value

| segment | age_band |
|----------------|----------------|
| 1              | Young Adults             |
| 2              | Middle Aged             |
| 3 or 4              | Retirees             |

* Add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the `segment` values:

| segment | demographic |
|----------------|----------------|
| C              | Couples             |
| F              | Families             |

* Ensure all `null` string values with an `"unknown"` string value in the original `segment` column as well as the new `age_band` and `demographic` columns
* Generate a new `avg_transaction` column as the `sales` value divided by `transactions` rounded to 2 decimal places for each record
