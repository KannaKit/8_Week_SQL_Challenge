# üõí Case Study #5 - Data Mart
## ‚öñÔ∏è 3. Before & After Analysis

This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

Taking the `week_date` value of `2020-06-15` as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

We would include all `week_date` values for `2020-06-15` as the start of the period **after** the change and the previous `week_date` values would be **before**

Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

### 1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after `2020-06-15`? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?

```TSQL
--determine week_number for 2020-06-15
SELECT week_number
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE week_date = '2020-06-15'
LIMIT 1;
```

| week_number  | 
|------------|
| 25 |

```TSQL
WITH cte AS (
SELECT CAST(SUM(sales)AS NUMERIC) sales_before
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE week_number IN (22,23,24,25)),

cte2 AS (
SELECT CAST(SUM(sales)AS NUMERIC) sales_after
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE week_number IN (26,27,28,29))

SELECT 
  sales_before, 
  sales_after, 
  (sales_after-sales_before) actual_value, 
  ROUND(((sales_after-sales_before)/sales_before),4) growth_rate
FROM cte, cte2;
```

| sales_before | sales_after | actual_value | growth_rate |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| 6706008229   | 6745365801  | 39357572     | 0.0059      |

---

### 2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?

```TSQL
WITH cte AS (
SELECT CAST(SUM(sales)AS NUMERIC) sales_before
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE week_number <= 25),

cte2 AS (
SELECT CAST(SUM(sales)AS NUMERIC) sales_after
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE week_number > 25)

SELECT 
  sales_before, 
  sales_after, 
  (sales_after-sales_before) actual_value, 
  ROUND(((sales_after-sales_before)/sales_before),4) growth_rate
FROM cte, cte2;
```

| sales_before | sales_after | actual_value | growth_rate |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| 22059704760	| 18683929467	| -3375775293	| -0.1530 |

---

### 3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?

```TSQL
--2018 VS. 2020

WITH cte AS (
SELECT CAST(SUM(sales)AS NUMERIC) sales_before
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE calendar_year = 2018),

cte2 AS (
SELECT CAST(SUM(sales)AS NUMERIC) sales_after
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE calendar_year = 2020)

SELECT 
  sales_before, 
  sales_after, 
  (sales_after-sales_before) actual_value, 
  ROUND(((sales_after-sales_before)/sales_before),4) growth_rate
FROM cte, cte2;
```

| sales_before | sales_after | actual_value | growth_rate |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| 12897380827	| 14100220900	| 1202840073	| 	0.0933 |
		

```TSQL
--2019 VS. 2020

WITH cte AS (
SELECT CAST(SUM(sales)AS NUMERIC) sales_before
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE calendar_year = 2019),

cte2 AS (
SELECT CAST(SUM(sales)AS NUMERIC) sales_after
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE calendar_year = 2020)

SELECT 
  sales_before, 
  sales_after, 
  (sales_after-sales_before) actual_value, 
  ROUND(((sales_after-sales_before)/sales_before),4) growth_rate
FROM cte, cte2;
```

| sales_before | sales_after | actual_value | growth_rate |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| 13746032500	| 14100220900	| 354188400	| 				0.0258 |
