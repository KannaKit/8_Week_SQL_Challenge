# ðŸŽ£ Case Study #6 - Clique Bait
## ðŸª„ 4. Campaigns Analysis

Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:

* `user_id`
* `visit_id`
* `visit_start_time`: the earliest `event_time` for each visit
* `page_views`: count of page views for each visit
* `cart_adds`: count of product cart add events for each visit
* `purchase`: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
* `campaign_name`: map the visit to a campaign if the `visit_start_time` falls between the `start_date` and `end_date`
* `impression`: count of ad impressions for each visit
* `click`: count of ad clicks for each visit
* **(Optional column)** `cart_products`: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the `sequence_number`)

Use the subsequent dataset to generate at least 5 insights for the Clique Bait team - bonus: prepare a single A4 infographic that the team can use for their management reporting sessions, be sure to emphasise the most important points from your findings.

Some ideas you might want to investigate further include:

* Identifying users who have received impressions during each campaign period and comparing each metric with other users who did not have an impression event
* Does clicking on an impression lead to higher purchase rates?
* What is the uplift in purchase rate when comparing users who click on a campaign impression versus users who do not receive an impression? What if we compare them with users who just an impression but do not click?
* What metrics can you use to quantify the success or failure of each campaign compared to eachother?

ðŸ”Ž Insights
------

**1. Customers who purchased product(s) viewed about twice more pages and added to their cart twice more than customers who didn't buy.** 

```TSQL
SELECT 
	CASE WHEN purchase=0 THEN 'did not purchase'
	ELSE 'purchased' END purchase_status, 
	ROUND(AVG(page_views),2) avg_page_view,
	ROUND(AVG(cart_adds),2) avg_cart_adds
FROM campaingns_analysis
GROUP BY purchase_status;
```

| purchase_status  | avg_page_view | avg_cart_adds |
|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| did not purchase | 	3.76          | 1.14          |
| purchased        | 	7.99          | 3.61          |

**2. The data suggests a correlation between customers who were exposed to the Clique Bait ad on search result pages or other websites and a slightly lower purchase rate. This observation implies potential areas for improvement in either the targeting strategy or the effectiveness of the Clique Bait ad.**  

```TSQL
SELECT
	impression impression_count,
	ROUND(SUM(purchase)::NUMERIC/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM campaingns_analysis)::NUMERIC*100,2) purchase_percentage
FROM campaingns_analysis
GROUP BY impression;
```

| impression_count  | purchase_percentage | 
|------------------|---------------|
| 0 | 	29.18          |
| 1       | 	20.68          |

**4. Based on the data, it is evident that the "BOGOF - Fishing For Compliments" campaign was the most effective, with a notable increase of 3.21% in fish sales. On the other hand, the analysis reveals that the "Half Off - Treat Your Shellf(ish)" campaign resulted in only a marginal increase of 0.67% in sales within the shellfish category. Similarly, the "25% Off - Living The Lux Life" campaign experienced a decline of 0.69% in luxury item sales. Considering these results, I would recommend focusing on developing more compelling campaigns that have a stronger appeal to our customer base. Alternatively, it may be worth considering discontinuing campaigns that fail to generate significant contributions to overall sales.**
