# ðŸŽ£ Case Study #6 - Clique Bait
## ðŸª„ 2. Campaigns Analysis

Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:

* `user_id`
* `visit_id`
* `visit_start_time`: the earliest `event_time` for each visit
* `page_views`: count of page views for each visit
* `cart_adds`: count of product cart add events for each visit
* `purchase`: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
* `campaign_name`: map the visit to a campaign if the `visit_start_time` falls between the `start_date` and `end_date`
* `impression`: count of ad impressions for each visit
* `click`: count of ad clicks for each visit
* **(Optional column)** `cart_products`: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the `sequence_number`)

Use the subsequent dataset to generate at least 5 insights for the Clique Bait team - bonus: prepare a single A4 infographic that the team can use for their management reporting sessions, be sure to emphasise the most important points from your findings.

Some ideas you might want to investigate further include:

* Identifying users who have received impressions during each campaign period and comparing each metric with other users who did not have an impression event
* Does clicking on an impression lead to higher purchase rates?
* What is the uplift in purchase rate when comparing users who click on a campaign impression versus users who do not receive an impression? What if we compare them with users who just an impression but do not click?
* What metrics can you use to quantify the success or failure of each campaign compared to eachother?

**1. Customers who purchased product(s) viewed about twice more pages and added to their cart twice more than customers who didn't buy.** 

```TSQL
SELECT 
	CASE WHEN purchase=0 THEN 'did not purchase'
	ELSE 'purchased' END purchase_status, 
	ROUND(AVG(page_views),2) avg_page_view,
	ROUND(AVG(cart_adds),2) avg_cart_adds

**2. Customers who saw the Clique Bait ad on their search result page or other site are twice more likely to purchase product(s) compared to customers who haven't seen the ads. This could be an indication that the Clique Bait ad is targeted toward the right audience or that the ad itself is effective in persuading customers to make a purchase. **  

```TSQL
SELECT
	impression impression_count,
	ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN purchase=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::NUMERIC/COUNT(*)::NUMERIC*100,2) purchase_percentage

**4. Based on the data, it is evident that the "BOGOF - Fishing For Compliments" campaign was the most effective, with a notable increase of 3.48% in fish sales. On the other hand, the "Half Off - Treat Your Shellf(ish)" and the "25% Off - Living The Lux Life" campaigns yielded only marginal gains of 0.82% and a negligible decrease of 0.69% in luxury item sales, respectively. Therefore, I highly recommend creating more attractive campaigns that will better appeal to our customers, or alternatively, discontinuing campaigns that fail to contribute significantly to sales.**
