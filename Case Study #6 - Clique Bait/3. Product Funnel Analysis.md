# ðŸŽ£ Case Study #6 - Clique Bait
## ðŸ’» 3. Product Funnel Analysis

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

* How many times was each product viewed?
* How many times was each product added to cart?
* How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
* How many times was each product purchased?

Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

```TSQL
--product table

--filter visit_id which has purchase event
WITH purchase_visit AS (
SELECT visit_id
FROM clique_bait.events e
WHERE event_type=3),

--pull out all the info for the visit_id which has a purchase event
purchased_item AS (
SELECT *
FROM clique_bait.events e
RIGHT JOIN purchase_visit pv ON e.visit_id=pv.visit_id
ORDER BY e.visit_id, sequence_number),
	
--determine purchased products
purchased_product AS(	
SELECT 
  e.page_id, 
  page_name, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN event_type=2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) purchase_count
FROM purchased_item e
LEFT JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy ph ON e.page_id=ph.page_id
WHERE e.page_id NOT IN (1,2,12,13)
GROUP BY e.page_id, page_name),

--join tables, add view_count and added_to_cart_count columns
--I had to do this because if I try to do SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type=3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) then it will return 0 because purchase event only occures on the confirmation page
view_add_purchase AS (
SELECT 
  e.page_id, 
  ph.page_name, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) view_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type=2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) added_to_cart_count,
  pp.purchase_count
FROM clique_bait.events e
LEFT JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy ph ON e.page_id=ph.page_id
LEFT JOIN purchased_product pp ON ph.page_name=pp.page_name
WHERE e.page_id NOT IN (1,2,12,13)
GROUP BY e.page_id, ph.page_name, pp.purchase_count)

	added_to_cart_count,
	added_to_cart_count-purchase_count abondon_count,

Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:

### 1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?

```TSQL
--the most viewed product
SELECT 
 	page_name, 
	MAX(view_count) view_count
FROM product_data
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

| page_name      | view_count |
|----------------|------------|
| Oyster        | 	1568       | 

```TSQL
--the most added to cart product
SELECT 
	page_name, 
	MAX(added_to_cart_count) added_to_cart_count
FROM product_data
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

| page_name      | added_to_cart_count |
|----------------|------------|
| Lobster        | 	968       | 

```TSQL
--the most purchased product
SELECT 
	page_name, 
	MAX(purchase_count) purchase_count
FROM product_data
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

| page_name      | purchase_count |
|----------------|------------|
| Lobster        | 	754       | 

---

### 2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?

```TSQL
SELECT 
	page_name, 
	MAX(abondon_count) abondon_count
FROM product_data
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

| page_name      | abondon_count |
|----------------|------------|
| Russian Caviar        | 	249       | 

---

### 3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?

```TSQL
SELECT 
	page_name, 
	ROUND(purchase_count::NUMERIC/view_count::NUMERIC*100,2) view_to_purchase_perc
FROM product_data
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

| page_name      | view_to_purchase_perc |
|----------------|------------|
| Lobster        | 	48.74       | 

---

### 4. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?

```TSQL
SELECT
	ROUND(AVG(added_to_cart_count::NUMERIC/view_count::NUMERIC*100),2) avg_view_to_cart_add_perc
FROM product_data;
```

| avg_view_to_cart_add_perc | 
|------------|
| 60.95	          |

### 5. What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?

```TSQL
SELECT
	ROUND(AVG(purchase_count::NUMERIC/added_to_cart_count::NUMERIC*100),2) avg_cart_to_purchase_perc
FROM product_data;
```

| avg_cart_to_purchase_perc | 
|--------|
| 75.93 |
